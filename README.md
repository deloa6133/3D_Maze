# 3D_Maze
DFS Recursive Backtracking Algorithm to generate a 3D Maze.

To run, pull repo and run the 3D Maze.exe file to launch the program.

Size limit is set small on the maze generation due to graphical output of the maze at each recursive call.
Without graphical output the maze generation can be increased exponentially without nearly as much impact on performance time.
